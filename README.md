# My Website

I bought a domain for no particular reason, and wanted to start hosting on it. Don't ask me why, but it's www.beanteam.nz.

I poked around with some html and css, threw up a few comics and called it done. 

Please, check it out, give me some feedback, but do not believe this is the extend of my web design capabilities. It's been
a long time since I made this website and I've learn quite a bit. It seems like more effort than it's worth to improve this 
website since I've given up on my dreams to make webcomics.
